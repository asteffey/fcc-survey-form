## Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-survey-form.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-survey-form)

This site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-survey-form.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-survey-form?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses HTML5, CSS3, and a little JavaScript to provide an example of a survey form.
Additionally, this project has a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis, with a Gulp file, and deployment to GitHub pages.
